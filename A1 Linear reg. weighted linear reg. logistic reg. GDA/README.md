# Assignment 1

The pdf ass1.pdf contains the problem statement. The ass1_data folder contains the training data to be used for learning. The plots folder contains the plots obtained after the training. The report contains a brief write up for the whole assignment.  


## Linear Regression

Gradient descent is used for learning. Initial theta is set in the code itself.
To run the program, enter the following command 

```
   python3 linearRegression.py  <alpha> <epsilon>
```

- **alpha** = gradient descent learning rate 

- **epsilon** = stopping criteria for gradient descent.

## Weighted Linear Regression

Normal Equations are used for learning.
To run the program, enter the following command 

```
   python3 weightedRegression.py <tau>
```

- **tau** = exponential weights parameter 


## Logistic Regression

Newton's Method is used for learning.
To run the program, enter the following command 

```
   python3 logisticRegression.py <epsilon>
```

- **epsilon** = stopping criteria for Newton's method.


## Gaussian Discriminant Analysis

Both linear and quadratic boundary has been plotted
To run the program, enter the following command 

```
   python3 GDA.py 
```
